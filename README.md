A little program to help me learn things I want to remember

A json file can be used to configure a question and answer set which will be used to select and store question information.

npm i tquiz
```

## Setup / Use

export these in your .bashrc or similar script with a tquiz at the end to run it every time you open a new shell

TQUIZ_NUMBER_OF_QUESTIONS = The number of questions you need to answer before tab 
TQUIZ_QUESTIONS_PATH = The place you add and edit questions
